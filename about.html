            Here at last is a subject I consider myself an expert in. Born in San Diego but left before I was a year old. I spent the better part of the last thrity seven years living in the Carson Valley area. I grew up in South Lake Tahoe untill I was about 10, from there moving down to Gardnerville. I lived between Gardnerville and Carson City for the majority of my life. In 2021 I decided it was time for a change of pace and re-located to Oklahoma. </p>

            I'm one of those people that has more hobbies than time. When I find something that interests me I can't help but persue it tenaciously. My favorite hobbies include watching movies, reading, learning to work on classic cars, video games, dungeons and dragons and all manner of other nerdy things. </p>

            Im a huge fan of anything horror related, movies, books, music. Ive attended horror conventions and I have a massive collection of movies, everything from serious highborw fare to the trashiest low budget B movies. Everyone asks for a top five list of movies but it's like trying to pick a favorite child. Typically when im working at the computer I'll leave random horor movies on in the background.

            For the bulk of my working life I worked as a casino bartender, twelve years at the same place between day swing and graveyard shift. One of my favorite regular customers became a good friend and offerd me a job working for him selling mattresses at his store. Because of the nature of that business I spent a great amount of time running things on my own, from open to close I handled almost every aspect of the operation until I moved out of state.
